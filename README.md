# vocal-grader
Grade entry with speech recognition (for teachers)

*Tentative Plan:*
Use Sphinx4 for voice recognition

*Program functionality:*
Allow user to say student name and a grade (numeric or A-F (or percentage?))

Output: either a csv file with student name (and ID?) and score

or

Edit existing csv file (already populated with student names/IDs) to update scores

User will have to provide list of student names (possibly w/ generated phonetic spellings)
